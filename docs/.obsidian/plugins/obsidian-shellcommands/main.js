 * Copied 2021-10-29 from https://gist.github.com/TheDistantSea/8021359
 * Modifications:
 *  - Made compatible with TypeScript by adding type definitions.
 *  - Changed var to let.
 *
 * Compares two software version numbers (e.g. "1.7.1" or "1.2b").
 *
 * This function was born in http://stackoverflow.com/a/6832721.
 *
 * @param {string} v1 The first version to be compared.
 * @param {string} v2 The second version to be compared.
 * @param {object} [options] Optional flags that affect comparison behavior:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>lexicographical: true</tt> compares each part of the version strings lexicographically instead of
 *         naturally; this allows suffixes such as "b" or "dev" but will cause "1.10" to be considered smaller than
 *         "1.2".
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>zeroExtend: true</tt> changes the result if one version string has less parts than the other. In
 *         this case the shorter string will be padded with "zero" parts instead of being considered smaller.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * @returns {number|NaN}
 * <ul>
 *    <li>0 if the versions are equal</li>
 *    <li>a negative integer iff v1 < v2</li>
 *    <li>a positive integer iff v1 > v2</li>
 *    <li>NaN if either version string is in the wrong format</li>
 * </ul>
