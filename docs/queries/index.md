To find the data to render the plugin allows multiple query engines to be use. Currently only the AlaSQL query engine has been enabled. This is a SQL base engine that allows you to use SQL statements to query collections of object in JavaScript or in memory tables with rows and columns.

Full details on AlaSQL can be found on the [AlaSQL Wiki](https://github.com/AlaSQL/alasql/wiki).
