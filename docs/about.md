This is a plugin for Obsidian that allows you to query internal data and render it anyway you want, it is designed to be extensible and flexible at the cost of increased complexity.

The main query language is SQL using Alasql as the engine. This allows the user to write queries against arrays, objects and object collections.

For rendering handlebars is used as the default render with some additional helpers specific to obsidian.

This is a work in progress and bound to have issues, please flag them and always feel free to contribute, as long as it looks good and will not break others it will probably go straight in. I aim for low friction public collaboration.
