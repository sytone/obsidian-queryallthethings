## Automatically via Community Plugins

In Obsidian:

1. Open Settings > Community plugins
2. Make sure Safe mode is off
3. Click Browse community plugins
4. Search for "Query All the Things"
5. Click Install

Once installed, close the community plugins window and activate the newly installed plugin

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin currently has a hard dependency on DataView, make sure it is installed as well. If it is not found you will get a message asking you to install it.

## Manually

Copy the main.js, style.css and manifest.json file from the latest release on [sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings:](https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings) to a folder called qatt in the plugins directory.
