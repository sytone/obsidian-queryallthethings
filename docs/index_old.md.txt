## History

This stared as a fork of tasks focused on making queries against tasks more flexible in Obsidian, I wanted to be able to query more than this. This is similar to the amazing [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) but I did not want to have to drop into JavaScript so much. This plugin has a dependency on [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) for the data it stores on pages, it uses this to pull out the different tables of data to speed up running queries. This was done so I did not have to duplicate the work already done in [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/).
