This folder contains examples that run when the parent document folder is loaded as an obsidian vault. They are to make playing with the plugin and examples simpler to do. They should reflect the written examples in the examples folder. 

Contributions are always welcome. 

These are based off use cases I have and may or may not work well in your model of knowledge management. Take what you want and learn from them, no one model works for everyone.
