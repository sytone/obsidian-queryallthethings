name: Auto Patch Release on PR Merge

# This workflow automatically creates a patch release when a PR is merged to main.
# 
# Process:
# 1. Triggers when a PR is merged (not just closed) to the main branch
# 2. Runs `pnpm run release:patch` which uses standard-version to:
#    - Bump the patch version in package.json, manifest.json, and versions.json
#    - Update CHANGELOG.md with changes since last release
#    - Create a git commit with the version changes
#    - Create a git tag with the new version number
# 3. Pushes the commit and tag to the main branch
# 4. The new tag triggers the existing release.yml workflow which:
#    - Builds the plugin
#    - Creates a DRAFT GitHub release that can be tested before publishing
#
# This allows maintainers to test each release in Obsidian before promoting it to users.
