      "0.8.7": "In this release the documentation has been updated and now has examples you can use locally by downloading and expanding the obsidian-queryallthethings.vault.zip file attached to each release or by cloning the repo and opening the docs folder in Obsidian as a vault. This will hopefully make understanding the plugin simpler by using live examples. \r\n\r\nA suggester prompt based off [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) has been added as an internal function and a new SQL function has been added allowing you to generate HTML that will prompt you for a value and update the page related to the row with the specified property name and selected value. This makes it easy to change the state of a page if you are rendering a table with values. It is more of a convenience for user aka me 😄. See [Using updatePropertyFromList](https://sytone.github.io/obsidian-queryallthethings/Examples/using-updatepropertyfromlist/) for details on using it. Please look at [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) and use if you do not already as it is an amazing plugin for the platform and props to @silentvoid13 for creating it. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* add suggester and setting display state ([150063b](https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings/commits/150063bbd367a30c355d50d5a66945504690c479))\r\n* add updatePropertyFromList sql function ([e20b590](https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings/commits/e20b5902b1b69915e4ed6ed93cc0360cdfe6547d))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n* add sql union documentation and example ([3a973b2](https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings/commits/3a973b2c8327c368e61209cde0ccd9eade131c1b))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Internal\r\n\r\n* add warning for CustomJS plugin if missing ([c7864a8](https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings/commits/c7864a852c54891aaea1021b9538c7efe2c6f920))\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings/compare/0.8.6...0.8.7"

      "0.8.8": "## Features\r\n- enable frontmatter data to be queried for page.\r\n- **render:** add 100+ handlebars helpers to rendering templates\r\n- return all query results as collection to be rendered and not just last query\r\n## Bug Fixes and Changes\r\n- add exclude to properties of example pages\r\n- remove log entry from get tasks function\r\n## Documentation\r\n- added help Url so HelpMate support is available.\r\n- update examples and simple queries\r\n\r\nThis example has two queries that are executed and the results from each query can be accessed via an index off result. It is in the form `result.[x]` where `x` is the query number starting from 0. In addition the first queries shows a page property being used, this can be use in the `WHERE` clause as well allowing queries to change based on frontmatter. Works great with MetaBind.\r\n\r\n```qatt\r\nquery: |\r\n  SELECT pageProperty('created') Created;\r\n  SELECT TOP 1 * FROM obsidian_markdown_notes\r\ntemplate:  |\r\n  {{#each result.[0]}}\r\n  This page was created on {{Created}}\r\n  {{/each}}\r\n  {{#each result.[1]}}\r\n  - {{name}}\r\n  {{/each}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the handlebars helpers shown at [handlebars-helpers/README.md at master · Budibase/handlebars-helpers (github.com)](https://github.com/Budibase/handlebars-helpers/blob/master/README.md) are also now available to be used in the templates section.\r\n\r\n"
