      "0.8.7": "In this release the documentation has been updated and now has examples you can use locally by downloading and expanding the obsidian-queryallthethings.vault.zip file attached to each release or by cloning the repo and opening the docs folder in Obsidian as a vault. This will hopefully make understanding the plugin simpler by using live examples. \r\n\r\nA suggester prompt based off [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) has been added as an internal function and a new SQL function has been added allowing you to generate HTML that will prompt you for a value and update the page related to the row with the specified property name and selected value. This makes it easy to change the state of a page if you are rendering a table with values. It is more of a convenience for user aka me ðŸ˜„. See [Using updatePropertyFromList](https://sytone.github.io/obsidian-queryallthethings/Examples/using-updatepropertyfromlist/) for details on using it. Please look at [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) and use if you do not already as it is an amazing plugin for the platform and props to @silentvoid13 for creating it. \r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* add suggester and setting display state ([150063b](https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings/commits/150063bbd367a30c355d50d5a66945504690c479))\r\n* add updatePropertyFromList sql function ([e20b590](https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings/commits/e20b5902b1b69915e4ed6ed93cc0360cdfe6547d))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n* add sql union documentation and example ([3a973b2](https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings/commits/3a973b2c8327c368e61209cde0ccd9eade131c1b))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Internal\r\n\r\n* add warning for CustomJS plugin if missing ([c7864a8](https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings/commits/c7864a852c54891aaea1021b9538c7efe2c6f920))\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-queryallthethings/compare/0.8.6...0.8.7"

It is in the form `result.[x]` where `x` is the query number starting from 0. In addition the first queries shows a page property being used, this can be use in the `WHERE` clause as well allowing queries to change based on frontmatter. Works great with MetaBind.\r\n\r\n```qatt\r\nquery: |\r\n  SELECT pageProperty('created') Created;\r\n  SELECT TOP 1 * FROM obsidian_markdown_notes\r\ntemplate:  |\r\n  {{#each result.[0]}}\r\n  This page was created on {{Created}}\r\n  {{/each}}\r\n  {{#each result.[1]}}\r\n  - {{name}}\r\n  {{/each}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the handlebars helpers shown at [handlebars-helpers/README.md at master Â· Budibase/handlebars-helpers (github.com)](https://github.com/Budibase/handlebars-helpers/blob/master/README.md) are also now available to be used in the templates section.\r\n\r\n"
